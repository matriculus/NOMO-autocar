# NOMO
NOMO is an autonomous toy car built using Raspberry Pi and Arduino board as OBC and controller. NOMO gets all the feed from the environment through PiCamera and UltraSonic Range Finder build in. NOMO detects lane and tries to navigate through the lane drawn in controlled environment. More work is going on in robust lane detection algorithms and neural networks. The basic idea is creating a recurrent convolutional neural network for training NOMO.
